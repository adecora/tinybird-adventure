I've been a fan of Tinybird for a while, often reading their blog posts and watching demos. But I'd never actually *used* it. You can't truly understand something until you try it yourself, so I decided to get my hands dirty and create my first Tinybird account.

<!--more-->

I started at the very beginning, following the [Chapter 1: Idea to Production][1] guide in the documentation. Before running the install script, I took a quick look at what I was downloading:

```bash
$ curl -s https://tinybird.co | cat
#!/bin/sh
# shellcheck shell=dash

# ... (rest of the script)
```

Everything looked good, so I ran the script and got set up.

```bash
$ uv tool list
litecli v1.13.2
- litecli
tinybird v0.0.1.dev266
- tb

```

Tinybird seems to be iterating quickly! Every time I start my container with `tb local start`, there's a *new version available*. 

![New Tinybird version available]({{ '/resource/day_one/tb-update.png' | relative_url }})

I now have Tinybird running locally in a Docker container:

![Tinybird local container]({{ '/resource/day_one/docker-tinybird.png' | relative_url }})

Before continuing with the tutorial, I poked around inside the container a bit.[^1]

```bash
docker inspect 1bd543200c7dfb5db96ed916b13277cc010c25b6279b29a6adbbd80808fa2dbf | llm 'gemini-pro' -s 'You are an expert devops engineer, give me a simple markdown report explaining me the content of the following docker container' | python -m rich.markdown -
```

![Tinybird local container inspection]({{ '/resource/day_one/docker-inspect-report.png' | relative_url }})

```bash
$docker exec -it tinybird-local ps aux | llm 'gemini-pro' -s 'You are an expert devops engineer, give me a simple markdown report explaining about the process running in the following docker container' | python -m rich.markdown -
```

![Tinybird local container processes]({{ '/resource/day_one/docker-ps-report.png' | relative_url }})

Back to the tutorial! I followed the steps until I successfully deployed my first data to the Tinybird cloud. ðŸŽ‰

![Tinybird workspace]({{ '/resource/day_one/workspace.png' | relative_url }})


./Conclusion
------------

I'm really enjoying the `tb` CLI so far. Here are a few things I particularly like:

* **Helpful suggestions:** The CLI provides suggestions if you misspell a command.  This is a small touch, but it makes a big difference in usability.
* **Autocompletions in `tb dev`:** The playground environment has excellent autocompletion, which speeds up development significantly.
* **`tb dev --ui` for exploring pipes:** This is a fantastic way to visualize and understand the flow of data through the pipe nodes.[^2]  It's much easier than my previous approach!

![Node UI exploration]({{ '/resource/day_one/nodes-UI.png' | relative_url }})


[^1]: The `vscode` processes you see are from my (somewhat clumsy) attempts to explore the container's file system.
[^2]: Before discovering this UI, I was trying to inspect intermediate nodes using CTEs (Common Table Expressions), which was a much less elegant solution. ðŸ˜°
