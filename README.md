# My Tinybird Application Adventure

Hi, I'm Alejandro de Cora. I didn't expect to be writing on [this repo](https://github.com/adecora/tinybird-adventure) again, but here we are!  This started as a playful experiment in prompt injecting my resume for a job application at Tinybird.

Now, I'm going to document my interview preparation journey here.  Think of it as a public notebook for tracking my progress and, hopefully, sharing some useful insights along the way.

The face of this repo is cortesy of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the design is borrowed from [sighingnow](https://github.com/sighingnow/sighingnow.github.io) which itself is a hevily modified version of [minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/).
