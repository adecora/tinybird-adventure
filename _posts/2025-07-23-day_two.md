Today, I wanted to experiment with the [Tinybird MCP][1]. Since I didn't have any workspaces with suitable data, I decided to create a new one using the iconic Titanic dataset from [the Kaggle competition][2].  My goal was to query this dataset using the MCP.


<!--more-->

The creation of the new `workspace` was pretty straighful.

```bash
$ mkdir titanic && cd titanic
# Download the train.csv and rename as titanic.csv
$ tb create
$ tb create --data titanic.csv
$ tb login
$ tb --cloud deploy
```

Well!!! I have a mispelling on *titanic* and create my `datasource` as *titanict*, in order to fix it I have to allow a destructive deploy

```bash
$ tb --cloud deploy --allow-destructive-operations
$ tb --cloud datasource append titanic --file fixtures/titanic.csv
```

With that corrected, my workspace was ready, and I could set up the MCP and start querying.

![Titanic dataset workspace]({{ '/resource/day_two/titanic-workspace.png' | relative_url }})

I hadn't used Claude before, so this was a new experience.  After configuring it:

```bash
$ code ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

I started playing around.

![Claude prompt]({{ '/resource/day_two/claude-prompt.png' | relative_url }})

Unfortunately, I ran into problems.  Of all the times to write a blog post, I chose one where the Claude MCP tools were failing!

./Interlude: Troubleshooting
----------------------------

After a few more unsuccessful attempts, I started looking for alternatives. I noticed `mcp-tinybird` was still running on my machine.

![Btop mcp-tinybird]({{ '/resource/day_two/mcp-tinybird.png' | relative_url }})

I decided to ask Copilot (in Agent mode with Claude Sonnet 4) to check for locally running MCP servers.

![Vscode detect running MCP servers]({{ '/resource/day_two/vscode-detect-running-servers.png' | relative_url }})

It detected the Tinybird MCP server, but couldn't communicate with it.  So, I fetched the Tinybird MCP documentation.

![Vscode fetching Tinybird MCP documentation]({{ '/resource/day_two/vscode-fetch-documentation.png' | relative_url }})

This time, Copilot successfully generated a Python script to list the MCP capabilities.

![Vscode list Tinybird MCP capabilities]({{ '/resource/day_two/vscode-list-capabilities.png' | relative_url }})

However, when I asked for the rows of my `titanic` datasource, it failed to communicate with the MCP server and resorted to using the Tinybird API instead.

![Vscode Tinybird API]({{ '/resource/day_two/vscode-tinybird-api.png' | relative_url }})

./Conclusion
------------

Not a complete win this time.  However, while I was trying these workarounds, the Claude MCP tool issue seemed to resolve itself.  I was then able to chat with my `titanic` datasource and get some interesting results!

![Claude survival analysis]({{ '/resource/day_two/claude-survival-analysis.png' | relative_url }})

![Claude first class passengers]({{ '/resource/day_two/claude-first-class-passengers.png' | relative_url }})


It seems the MCP journey can be a bit bumpy, but the destination is worth it!
